         <!-- List of the cake ingredients-->
         <h3>Cake Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Crisco® Original No-Stick Cooking Spray</li>
            <li>½ cup SMUCKER'S® Caramel Flavored Topping</li>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package devil's food cake mix</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ cup Crisco® Pure Vegetable Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Flan Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can EAGLE BRAND® Sweetened Condensed Milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can PET® Evaporated Milk</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 12-cup fluted tube
                 pan with nonstick spray. Place a piece of rolled-up foil into the tube part 
                 of the pan to prevent cake from spilling over the top. Pour caramel topping 
                 into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Beat cake mix, water, 3 eggs, and vegetable oil together in a large bowl until
                 well combined; pour evenly over caramel topping.</li>
            <li>Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, 4 eggs, cream cheese, and vanilla in 
                a blender. Process until smooth; pour slowly over cake batter. While baking, 
                the cake will rise and the milk mixture will go to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Coat a piece of foil with nonstick spray. Cover the pan tightly with foil, 
                coated-side down. Place the pan in a large roasting pan. Pour hot water into 
                the roasting pan to a depth of 2 inches.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out 
                with a few moist crumbs on it, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Place cake on a cooling rack; cool for 15 minutes. Remove foil and invert onto 
                a serving plate. Cool for 1 hour at room temperature. Chill for 4 hours or 
                overnight before serving.</li>
        </ol>

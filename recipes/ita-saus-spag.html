    <h1>Italian Sausage Spaghetti</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is my favorite method of making Italian sausage spaghetti. 
        By browning the sausages first and then cooking them in the sauce at a long, slow simmer, 
        the sausage is loaded with flavor and firm, but tender--almost meatball-like in texture. 
        And we hardly need any seasonings because the long cook time allows the sauce to get infused 
        with all the sausage-y goodness!</p>
